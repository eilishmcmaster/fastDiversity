\title{Calculate individual inbreeding coefficient (Wright's F)}
\usage{
individual_F(
  gt,
  genetic_group_variable = NULL,
  site_variable = NULL,
  minimum_loci = 50,
  maf = 0.05,
  max_missingness = 0.3,
  minimum_n = 3,
  table_out = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gt}{Genotype matrix where individuals are rows and loci are columns, coded as 
0=aa, 1=aA, 2=AA.}

\item{genetic_group_variable}{(optional) Vector of genetic group IDs for each individual (same 
length as number of rows in gt). Can represent species, 
subspecies, or other biologically relevant structure groups. If not
included, the whole gt will be treated as one group.}

\item{site_variable}{(optional) Vector of site IDs for each individual. If supplied, expected heterozygosity will be calculated within sites, which will probably result in F being lower due to the Wahlund effect.}

\item{minimum_loci}{(optional) Minimum number of loci required to proceed with analysis for each 
genetic group (genetic groups with fewer loci will be skipped).}

\item{maf}{(optional) Minimum minor allele frequency filter.}

\item{max_missingness}{(optional) Maximum proportion of missing data allowed per locus (loci with 
higher missingness will be filtered out).}
}
\value{
A named vector containing F for each individual in gt.
}
\description{
This function calculates Wright's F (individual inbreeding coefficient), the probability 
that two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent. Calculation from
Frankham, Ballou, & Briscoe (2010, p 266) F= 1-(Ho/He).
